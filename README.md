# Digital Detective 🕵️‍♀️  
An interactive educational exercise designed for students (ages 10–14) to improve their attention and digital literacy by spotting fake or suspicious emails.

## 💡 What it teaches
Students learn to:
- Recognize visual differences between legitimate and fake emails.  
- Identify subtle signs of phishing or manipulation (wrong sender, missing diacritics, fake links, urgency, etc.).  
- Build critical thinking and attention to detail.

## 🎮 How it works
The webpage shows **two email examples side by side**:  
one is real, the other is a fake version.  
Students must select which email looks genuine and can reveal clues afterward.

- Develop digital awareness in a playful way.  
- Encourage conversation about online trust and safety.  
- Demonstrate real-world examples of phishing tactics.
